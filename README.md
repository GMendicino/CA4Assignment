Development Approach

I wasn't familiar with either personal or professional portfolio websites, as such, I had to look online for examples, and took much inspiration from there. I used many different elements of programming, such as HTML, JavaScript and CSS, this was to create a more visually appealing experience.

Challenges

I faced challenges across virtually all aspects of development, but putting everything where it belonged was very cumbersome. For example, in the about page, where it took a lot of trial and error to properly implement the Contact Me box and the 'Things I love' box. 

Technical Details of Chat's Client-Server Communication:

Socket.io served as the foundation for client-server communication in our chat application. This JavaScript library allows bidirectional, event-based communication between clients and the server, making real-time interaction feasible. Distinct chat rooms for various uses or user groups by utilising Socket.io's rooms and namespaces capability are present. Better conversation management and organisation were made possible by this within the chat program.
